This is a digital remake with custom additions of the popular memory game from the late 1970s called Simon Game! 
The game contains a various number of cells which light up in a randomized order. The objective is to click each cell in correct sequential order with each level increasing the sequence by one. Get as far as you can in levels before the time runs out! There are 3 modes of increasing difficulty!
